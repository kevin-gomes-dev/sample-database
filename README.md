Just a small repo to learn how to set up backend + frontend only using JS and frameworks.
.env file needed to setup environment variables. These include:

- USER (The user for the database)
- PASSWORD (The user's password)
- PORT (The port to run the server on)
- DATABASE (The name of the database we create/connect to);
